### Today's Tasks

*   None scheduled for today

### Today's Accomplishments

1.  **Mathematical Derivation**: I successfully derived the formula for calculating the area under a curve using the Riemann Sum method.
    *   This involved applying the concept of infinitesimal change to the area calculation, which was a challenging but rewarding exercise in mathematical reasoning.
2.  **Programming Progress**: I made significant progress in learning and implementing the Mathematica (Mma) software for symbolic computation and data analysis.
    *   Specifically, I successfully created a custom function to generate fractals using Mma's built-in functions and explored various parameters to produce visually striking patterns.

**Reflection**
---------------

Today was a productive day, with significant progress made in both mathematical derivations and programming. The ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems is an essential skill for any mathematician or scientist. I will continue to work on refining my skills in these areas and exploring new applications of mathematics in various fields.

**Notes**
----------

*   Review notes from yesterday's lecture on differential equations
*   Continue working on the programming project using Mma software
*   Explore the application of fractals in real-world problems, such as image compression and data analysis
